Correctness:

- The program produces incorrect output. For the following acceptable solution,
  your program simply displays a blank window and nothing else (no buttons):
--
$ java driverDFA gncgwng  
--


Style:

- Incorrect indentation in both the driver and ManWolf files. Please use a
  two-space indentation.

- Good block comments

- You are using TABs!!!

- Code (or comments) go beyond 100 characters. Keep lines of code short.
  Optimally 80 characters, but no more than 100.


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is very inefficient as implemented. You were not asked to do any
  sophisticated programming, but just a simple command line input/output thing.

- Your program is supposed to run by taking input as an argument in command
  line, as follows (from the handout):
--
$ java driverDFA gncgwng 
--
  but your program is opening a blank window, which is not what you were asked to
  do in the handout.


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.
